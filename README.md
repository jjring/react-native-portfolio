## React native Portfolio
This repo contains a subset of the code I wrote for the React Native Map My Drive app available on iOS and Android. 

### Map My Drive
Map My Drive is a React Native app built for iOS and Android. It simply tracks your route as you drive, run, bike, or just move around. It makes sharing your routes easy by sharing a link to map that can be opened on a computer or mobile device or by exporting the route as different file types.
